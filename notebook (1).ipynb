    "After realizing our previous attempts to predict star ratings were not yielding satisfactory results, we decided to take a different approach. Instead of directly predicting star ratings, we focused on a simpler question: Can we determine if a recipe is \"good\" or not? We defined \"good\" as recipes with a 5-star rating. To answer this question, we used a Perceptron model, a binary classification model.which will  determine if a recipe is 5 stars or not. if the model was relatively successful we wanted to look at the weights of the model to get an indication for what are the contibuting factors and what are the hindering factors.\n",

Our goal was to uncover patterns and insights that distinguish these exceptional recipes. Through the Perceptron model, we aimed to discover the key factors that contribute to a recipe's top rating so it could be used to develop new recipes with a higher likelihood of achieving the coveted 5-star status.\n",

Recipes with shorter cooking times, lower servings (indicating higher calories per serving), and unique ingredients tend to have a higher likelihood of receiving a 5-star rating. Additionally, the negative weight associated with popularity score suggests that recipes with lower popularity scores may be more likely to receive higher ratings. This supports our hypothesis that incorporating rare ingredients (such as caviar or lobster as an example) could potentially improve the chances of a recipe being rated highly.
