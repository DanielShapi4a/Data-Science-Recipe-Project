    "After realizing our previous attempts to predict star ratings were not yielding satisfactory results, we decided to take a different approach. Instead of directly predicting star ratings, we focused on a simpler question: Can we determine if a recipe is \"good\" or not? We defined \"good\" as recipes with a 5-star rating. To answer this question, we used a Perceptron model, a binary classification model that determines if a recipe is 5 stars or not. By training the model on factors like cooking time, ingredients, and nutritional values, we aimed to identify what makes these top-rated recipes stand out.\n",

Our goal was to uncover patterns and insights that distinguish these exceptional recipes. Through the Perceptron model, we aimed to discover the key factors that contribute to a recipe's top rating and use this knowledge to develop new recipes with a higher likelihood of achieving the coveted 5-star status.\n",

    "We were thrilled with the remarkable result we achieved using the Perceptron model: an impressive accuracy score of 0.95. It seemed almost too good to be true, so we decided to put it to the test. We selected 20 recipes from a different website that were not part of our original dataset, and to our delight, the model accurately predicted whether these recipes would be rated as 5 stars or not. This outcome reinforced our confidence in the model's ability to identify exceptional recipes and opened up exciting possibilities for future applications and enhancements."

    "Based on the weights obtained from our model, we identified the top 5 factors that contribute the most to a recipe being rated as 5 stars. These factors include:\n",
    "prep time,cook time,servings,calories,number of ingredients and number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables had the highest weights in our weights dataframe, indicating their significant influence on the rating. Conversely, we also identified the 5 worst ingredients, which included popularity score, prep, cook, total time, and servings. These factors had negative weights, suggesting that recipes with longer preparation and cooking times, higher total time, and larger servings are less likely to receive a 5-star rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings provide valuable insights into the preferences of users when it comes to recipe ratings. Recipes with shorter cooking times, lower servings (indicating higher calories per serving), and unique ingredients tend to have a higher likelihood of receiving a 5-star rating. Additionally, the negative weight associated with popularity score suggests that recipes with lower popularity scores may be more likely to receive higher ratings. This supports our hypothesis that incorporating rare ingredients such as caviar or lobster could potentially improve the chances of a recipe being rated highly. Overall, these findings open up new possibilities for creating recipes that align with user preferences and have a higher probability of receiving favorable ratings."
